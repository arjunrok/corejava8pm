	 *    # use for code re-usability
	 *    
	 *    # process of accessing properties and methods of super/base/parent class
	 *      to sub/derived/child class is known as inheritance.
	 *      
	 *   # also known as IS-A relationship
	 *   
	 *   # its  a generalization to specialization process.
	 *      
	 *   Syntax :
	 *   
	 *        class child_class_name extends parent_class_name {
	 *        
	 *          //properties :   child properties + parent properties
	 *          
	 *          //methods    :    child methods + parent methods
	 *        }
	 *      
	 *      e.g.
	 *      
	 *        class A{
	 *        
	 *        }
	 *
